# FashionVista - AI-Integrated Fashion E-commerce Platform with Virtual Try-Room

**FashionVista** is an AI-integrated fashion e-commerce platform designed to provide users with a virtual try-on experience. This platform allows users to choose shirts from a collection, upload a photo, and see how the shirt fits them using AI-based image processing.

## Features
- **User Registration & Login**: Users can register and log in to their accounts.
- **Virtual Try-Room**: Allows users to upload a photo and see how different shirts will look on them.
- **E-commerce functionality**: Browse products, add to cart, and proceed to checkout.
- **User Profile**: View and manage account details.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - React.js (for building user interface)
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  - React Router (for page navigation)
  
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js with Express (for handling server-side logic)
  - MongoDB (for storing user data and product information)
  - Cloudinary (for image upload and processing)
  
- **AI Integration**: Image processing algorithms for the virtual try-on feature.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fashionvista.git
cd fashionvista
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Backend

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend and set the necessary environment variables like:

```env
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
PORT=8080
DB_NAME=backned_fyp
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database
```

- Replace `your_database` with the name of your MongoDB database.
  
### 4. Run the Development Servers

#### Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:8080`.

#### Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

This will start the frontend React app on `http://localhost:5173`.

### 5. Testing the Application

- After starting both servers, navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
- Register an account, log in, browse products, and try on virtual shirts by uploading your photo.

### 6. Build for Production

If you want to build the project for production:

#### Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready build in the `frontend/build` folder.

#### Backend:

You can deploy the backend to your preferred cloud service like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
